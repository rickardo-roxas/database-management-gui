## Description
The MixedFractionArithmetic class is a programming class that performs arithmetic operations on mixed fractions. In mathematics, a mixed fraction is a combination of a whole number and a fraction. The MixedFractionArithmetic class is designed to accept mixed fraction inputs and perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The class typically contains methods that allow for the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of mixed fractions. These methods usually take in two or more mixed fractions as input and return a mixed fraction as the result of the arithmetic operation. Additionally, the class may contain methods for simplifying the mixed fraction, converting it to an improper fraction or a decimal, and comparing two mixed fractions for equality or magnitude.

## Installation and Usage
To use the MixedFractionArithmetic class, simply download the source code and run the program on your computer. The program requires an IDE or a Java development environment to run. The program also includes a GUI class that allows for user input and output of mixed fraction arithmetic calculations.

To use the GUI, simply launch the program and input the mixed fractions you wish to perform arithmetic operations on. The program will display the output of the arithmetic operation in the result field.

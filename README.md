## Group Project 2 - MixedFractionArithmetic
MixedFractionCalculator

## Description
The MixedFractionArithmetic class is a programming class that performs arithmetic operations on mixed fractions. In mathematics, a mixed fraction is a combination of a whole number and a fraction. The MixedFractionArithmetic class is designed to accept mixed fraction inputs and perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The class typically contains methods that allow for the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of mixed fractions. These methods usually take in two or more mixed fractions as input and return a mixed fraction as the result of the arithmetic operation. Additionally, the class may contain methods for simplifying the mixed fraction, converting it to an improper fraction or a decimal, and comparing two mixed fractions for equality or magnitude.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

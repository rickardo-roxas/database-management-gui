# CS122_9301Team8
A group programming project for the course CS 122 - Computer Programming 2 (AY 2022-2023).
Midterm and Finals.

## Description
### DeTorres_Delizo_Lacanilao_Limboc_Ragudos_Roxas
Mixed Fraction Calculator.
The Mixed Fraction Calculator is a programming class that performs arithmetic operations on mixed fractions, which are a combination of a whole number and a fraction. The class contains methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of mixed fractions, as well as simplifying mixed fractions, converting them to improper fractions or decimals, and comparing them for equality or magnitude.
This project aims to apply the concepts of inheritance, Java Swing GUI, exception handling, iteration, and arithmetic operations.

### FinalProject1
Curriculum Checklist Management.
The Curriculum Checklist Management manages a computer science student's record of courses and respective grades from first to fourth year based on the standard BSCS (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) curriculum of AY 2022-2023.
This project aims to apply the concepts of inheritance, Java Swing GUI, file input/output, and exception handling.

### FinalProject2
Citizen Database Management.
The Citizen Database Management creates useful outputs from 600 citizens. These outputs include searching/indexing a citizen, displaying citizens based on given filters, displaying citizens with specific domains from their emails using given filters, the graphical demographics of the citiziens.
This project aims to apply the concepts of inheritance, interfaces, functional programming, Java Swing GUI, Java Stream, file input, exception handling, and
